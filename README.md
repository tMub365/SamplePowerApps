# My Sample PowerApps

Happy to share some of my PowerApps projects that I think might be interesting with the community.
I tend to spend too much time on UI/UX and I hope someone else finds them useful for their project . . .  Just load the .msapp file and customise it to your heart's content.

A gallery that can be applied to a canvas app to select various parts of the body.
Use case: A reporting app that requires that the injured body part be submitted as a multi-choice option to a DB.
